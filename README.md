Hi! My name is Jose Mora.

I work as a logistics consultant, but I identify more as a development enthusiast. I am in charge of implementing business optimization models, from commercial forecasting to minimizing transport route costs.

Generally my work is done in Python but I also use Flutter to work on mobile projects.

I want to share my work because I believe that it is the best way to learn from others how they know more than me.
